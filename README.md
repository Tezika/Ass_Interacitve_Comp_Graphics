# Ass_Interacitve_Comp_Graphics
This repo works for assignments of the class, Interactive_Comp_Graphics, CS6610. The main objective of this course is to learn some fundamental concepts of interactive rendering in computer graphics. At the conclusion of this course I would do:
 * Understand the stages of the interactive graphics rendering pipeline,
 * Effectively use OpenGL and GLSL,
 * Write complex GPU shaders, and
 * Implement modern interactive rendering methods.
